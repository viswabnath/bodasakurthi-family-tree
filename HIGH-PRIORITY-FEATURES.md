# High Priority Features - v1.4.0

## âœ… Implemented Features

### 1. Undo/Redo Functionality
- Full history management with 10-action memory
- Undo/Redo buttons in admin toolbar
- Keyboard shortcuts: Cmd/Ctrl+Z (undo), Cmd/Ctrl+Y (redo)
- Shows action name in tooltips
- Prevents data loss from mistakes

### 2. Recursive Generation Recalculation
- Automatically recalculates all generations after changes
- Works with deep hierarchies (5+ generations)
- Handles multiple root trees
- Triggered after add/edit/delete operations

### 3. Circular Relationship Prevention
- Detects and blocks impossible relationships
- Prevents person from being their own ancestor
- Clear error messages when blocked
- Graph traversal algorithm with cycle detection

### 4. Validation Warnings
- Age validation (parent too young)
- Date consistency checks
- Duplicate name warnings
- Generation mismatch detection
- Non-blocking (shows warnings but allows save)

### 5. Error Handling with Rollback
- Database failures automatically revert UI
- Try-catch wrapping all save operations
- Restores previous state on error
- Clear error notifications

## ðŸŽ¯ Technical Implementation

### New State Variables
```javascript
const [history, setHistory] = useState([]);
const [historyIndex, setHistoryIndex] = useState(-1);
const [isUndoing, setIsUndoing] = useState(false);
```

### New Utility Functions
- `recalculateGenerations()` - Recursive generation update
- `recalculateAllGenerations()` - Multi-root tree support
- `detectCircularRelationship()` - Cycle detection
- `getValidationWarnings()` - Data quality checks
- `saveToHistory()` - History management
- `handleUndo()` - Undo operation
- `handleRedo()` - Redo operation

### Integration Points
All operations (add/edit/delete) now include:
1. Circular relationship check (blocking)
2. Validation warnings (non-blocking)  
3. Generation recalculation
4. History saving
5. Error handling with rollback
